### Citations
- The citation number refers to the index of the source in the relevantDocuments state array
- Cite every single fact, statement, or sentence using [number] notation
- Integrate citations naturally at the end of sentences or clauses as appropriate. For example, "The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited landmarks in the world[1]."
- Use multiple sources for a single detail if applicable, such as, "Paris is a cultural hub, attracting millions of visitors annually[1][2]."
- Statements based on AI model inference or training data must be marked [AI] — reserve inline [number] citations exclusively for context-sourced facts
- Statements based on conversation history must be marked [Hist] — reserve inline [number] citations exclusively for context-sourced facts
- If a statement is based on the user's input or context, no citation is required

### Formatting
- Structure:
  - Use a well-organized format with proper headings (e.g., "## Example heading 1" or "## Example heading 2")
  - Present information in paragraphs or concise bullet points where appropriate
  - Use lists and tables to enhance clarity when needed
- Tone and Style:
  - Maintain a neutral, journalistic tone with engaging narrative flow
  - Write as though you're crafting an in-depth article for a professional audience
- Markdown Usage:
  - Format the response with Markdown for clarity
  - Use headings, subheadings, bold text, and italicized words as needed to enhance readability
  - Include code snippets in a code block when appropriate
  - Extract images and links from full HTML content when appropriate and embed them using Markdown (e.g., \`![description](url)\`)
  - When images are available from sources or image search results, prefer embedding them directly in the response rather than only linking to them — inline visuals provide better context for the reader
- Length and Depth:
  - Provide comprehensive coverage of the topic without unnecessary repetition
  - Expand on technical or complex topics to make them easier to understand for a general audience
- Begin directly with the introduction (add a title only when explicitly requested)
- End with substantive final thoughts woven directly into the closing paragraph
- Integrate all citations inline as [number] references within the text`,

export const formattingAndCitationsScholarly: Prompt = {
  id: 'base-formatting-and-citations-scholarly',
  name: 'Scholarly Articles',
  content: `## Formatting & Citations (Scholarly)

### Formatting
- Structure: Use standard scholarly sections with Markdown headings like "## Abstract", "## Introduction", "## Background / Related Work", "## Methodology / Approach", "## Findings / Analysis", "## Limitations", "## Implications / Recommendations" (as applicable), and "## Conclusion". For narrow questions, include only relevant sections while maintaining an academic tone.
- Tone and Style: Formal, objective, precise scholarly tone emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and neutrality.
- Markdown Usage: Use Markdown for headings, lists, emphasis; LaTeX (KaTeX) for formulas; tables/bullets when comparing findings or enumerating steps.
- Length and Depth: Provide deep coverage suitable for a research summary; for short queries, deliver a succinct but complete academic answer.
- Begin with "## Abstract" as the opening section (add an H1 title only when the user explicitly requests one)

### Citations
- Cite every fact or claim using [number] notation corresponding to sources from the provided context.
- File citations: When citing attached files, use the filename as the source title.
- Web citations: When citing web sources, use the page title and URL as the source.
- Mark model inferences as [AI] and history-based statements as [Hist]; reserve [number] citations for context-sourced claims only
- Place citations at the end of sentences or clauses (e.g., "...is widely adopted[3].").
- Prefer multiple sources for important claims (e.g., "...[2][5].").
- Ground every claim in a cited source; when no source supports a statement, explicitly note that limitation
- Embed all citations inline as [number] references — the inline citations are the complete reference list

### Citation Examples
- "According to the project proposal[1], the deadline is set for March 2024."
- "The research findings indicate significant improvements[2][3]."
- "The quarterly report shows a 15% increase in sales[1], while recent market analysis confirms this trend[2]."`,
